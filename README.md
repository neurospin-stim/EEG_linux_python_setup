This collection of files contains the basis for a python experiment using both
ET and EGI at NeuroSpin â€” presumably with the baby eeg linux setup.

Note that:

* some of this code belongs to "Tobii" (everything in/related to "tobii_research")
* some is a port in python 3 from a port in python 2 from a thing written in
  C++ from another era. It looks like the original inspiration was here: https://code.google.com/archive/p/libnetstation/

  I am responsible for the `python 2` -> `python 3` conversion, but I only took
  care of what was useful for my experiment, and you may run into weird bugs.

Nothing here should be too mysterious. I used expyriment but it should be easy
to swap that for other frameworks.
